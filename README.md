## SET UP AND RUNNING THE GAME

This arcade game is created utilizing HTML, CSS and JavaScript (ES6). As of August 2017, the following browsers support ES6: Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari and Opera. If there are any issues while utilizing other browsers, including Internet Explorer, you may utilize a compiler, such as Babel (https://babeljs.io/), to get ES6 to work with your browser.

To run the game, go to https://aileneh2020.github.io/ArcadeGame/. The game should start automatically once the page is rendered.


## HOW TO PLAY

Objective: To get your player safely across the pavement to the water while avoiding collision with the enemy bugs.

Movement: The player moves one block at a time. Movement is controlled by the user via the up, down, left and right arrows.

Collision: When the player collides with an enemy bug (both player and any enemy bug occupy the same block), the player is sent back to the start position.

Winning: When the player successfully reaches the water, the game is won and all characters on the game board stop moving. User is given the option to Replay which will reset and restart the game board.
